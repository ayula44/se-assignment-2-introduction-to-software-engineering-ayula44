# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
software engineering deals with the development and the maintenance of software systems for end users

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering follows a clearly defined structural approach to software development with specific goals in mind whereas programming is all about writing computer instructions to develop software
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
phases of software development life cycle include:
planning: this is where goals of creating the software are looked into. what does the software plan to achieve? and what problems does it wish to solve?
requirement analysis: user requirements and developer requirements are analysed here such as budgeting and time constraints
implementation: the software is created here. here coding takes place
testing: the software developed is tested for errors and corrections
deployment: software is released and distributed to end users
maintenance: here, software released is edited to meet user requirement and operating environment

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
the agile model is from bottom to top. it follows user requirements and software can be updated and edited at any time while water fall approach follows a sequential process where a developer cannot move to the next level of development if the previous level of development are not satisfied

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
this is the process of identifying the needs of a software.
this is important to ensure that the software being developed meets user needs
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
modularity means dividing a system into various modules as per functionality. this is important to ensure that components of a software can be maintained easily without affecting the entire system

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing describes a process of testing by modules or functionality in isolation
integration testing is the process of testing the the interaction of separate modules of a system together
system testing is a process of testing the whole system as a whole to ensure that it meets the user requirements
acceptance testing is usually done by the end user. this tests acceptablility by potential customers

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
these are tools that are used  to track changes to files and programs over time. they ensure that there can be integration among programs of different developers.
an example of VCS is git. it has a vast number of tools such as gitbash and github
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
A software project manager takes the lead in the creation and maintenance of any software. 
his responsibilities include: project planning, time management, budget management .etc. while some challenges include time constraints and budget limitations.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
software maintenance defines the processes of editing, updating and managing a software so as to meet user specified  needs and as  well meet the requirements of the operating environment.
it is an essential part of the software development life cycle because it helps developers to meet user needs over time and helps the software maintain relevance in the market.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
some ethical issues faced by engineers may include professional issues, environmental impact of the software, security issues and misuse of technology by end users. 
software engineers can ensure adherence to ethical standards by being professional at all times and also educating themselves from time to time

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
